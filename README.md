# SimpleStoryTellGame_PointerCPP

When i was a Practice Assistant (Asisten Praktikum), many times i help my junior with teaching and mentoring them. One of many hard study material of c++ is pointer and data tree, and i'm teaching a lot of it to them. From that experience, some day, i have an idea to make some simple game by implementing pointer with story to help them visualize it, with this i can make them understand it easier because i have one real fun example implementation of pointer.
